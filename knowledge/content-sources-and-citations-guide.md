# Content Sources and Citations Guide

## What Makes a Source Trustworthy?

A trustworthy source must have research-based or evidence-based information. It should have no paid affiliations influencing content. There must be a clear editorial process or peer review system. The authorship and credentials should be transparent. Publication dates should be recent or the content regularly updated. The source should be a recognized authority in their field.

## Source Evaluation Framework

**Most Trustworthy Sources**
These include peer-reviewed academic journals, government agencies with .gov domains, professional associations in [your industry], established research institutions like Pew Research or [industry analyst], university research centers with .edu domains, and industry-standard publications like [respected publication].

**Generally Trustworthy Sources**
These encompass reputable news organizations like Wall Street Journal or Forbes (when citing data, not opinion pieces), well-established industry publications like [industry publication] for industry news, expert-authored content where credentials are clearly stated, non-profit organizations with relevant expertise, and government-funded research databases.

**Use with Caution**
These include company blogs that demonstrate clear expertise but may have bias, Wikipedia for general overview only but never as a primary source, and company-published research where you must note potential bias.

**Never Use as Sources**
Never cite competitor content, unverified user-generated content like Reddit comments, sites with unclear authorship, sources more than 3 years old for statistics, sites overwhelmed with ads or sponsored content, or sources with obvious conflicts of interest.

## Industry-Specific Trusted Sources

**For [Industry Topic] Topics**

## Citation Best Practices

**In-Text Citations for Digital Content**
Use descriptive hyperlinks within the text. The anchor text should describe what the reader will find. Always link to primary sources when possible, not articles about the research.

Good example: According to recent [source] research on [topic], [finding with specific data].
Poor example: According to research (click here), [vague claim].

**Citation Requirements by Content Type**
For blog posts and articles, use inline hyperlinks, include the publication date when citing statistics, and link to the specific section of long documents.

For white papers and research documents, include a formal bibliography at the end, use consistent citation formatting throughout, and number citations if there are more than 10.

For social media posts, include the link in the post or first comment, use URL shorteners only when necessary for character limits, and screenshot any content that might change or be deleted.

## Fact-Checking Process

**Before Publishing**
Verify all statistics by checking the original source, confirming data is less than 3 years old, and noting sample size and methodology. Cross-reference any claims by finding at least two reputable sources, checking for industry consensus, and noting any significant disagreements. For expert quotes, verify credentials, confirm quote accuracy, and ensure proper context.

**Red Flags to Watch For**
Be suspicious of statistics without clear sources, absolute claims using words like always or never, outdated information presented as current, correlation presented as causation, or anecdotal evidence presented as proof.

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before citing a source, verify author credentials are clearly stated and relevant. Ensure publication date is recent enough for your purpose (within 3 years for statistics). Check for obvious conflicts of interest or bias. Confirm the information is factual, not opinion, unless opinion is specifically needed. Verify the source is appropriate for your professional audience. Test all links to ensure they work. Check copyright and usage permissions.
