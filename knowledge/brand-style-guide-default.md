# Brand Style Guide: Quick Reference

## 1. Brand Basics

**Brand name:** [Brand Name]

**Always written as:** [Brand] (not [BRAND] or [brand])

**What we do in one sentence:** We make [product/service] that helps [target audience] [achieve outcome].

## 2. Our Voice

We sound professional but not corporate. We sound friendly but not overly casual. We sound confident but not arrogant. We sound helpful but not condescending.

In three words, we are clear, human, and reliable.

## 3. Tone Adjustments by Context

**Educational content (blogs, guides, FAQs)**
Tone: Informative, conversational, practical, encouraging

**Customer communications (support, emails, chat)**
Tone: Warm, patient, empathetic, solution-focused

**Marketing content (ads, social, landing pages)**
Tone: Energetic, benefit-focused, inspiring, direct

## 4. Grammar Quick Rules

**Basics:**
Oxford comma: Yes
Numbers: Spell out under 10 / Use numerals for 10+
Time: 3 p.m. ET (not 3PM EST or 15:00)
Contractions: Yes, use them to sound more natural

**Capitalization:**
Our products/services: Capitalize product names ([Product One], [Product Two])
Job titles: Lowercase unless before a name
Industry terms: Lowercase unless proper nouns

**Punctuation:**
Exclamation points: One per piece maximum, avoid in formal communications
Em dashes: Avoid (use commas or parentheses instead)

## 5. Write This, Not That

Don't write: "Our revolutionary solution will transform your entire business ecosystem with cutting-edge technology."

Do write: "Our [product] helps your team get more done with less stress."

Because: We value clarity over buzzwords. Our customers want to know what we do, not wade through jargon.

## 6. Our Dictionary

Say "team members" not "resources" because people aren't resources.
Say "pricing" not "investment" to be direct about cost.
Say "challenge" not "pain point" to avoid corporate jargon.
Say "use" or "try" not "leverage" to keep it simple.
Say "help" not "empower" to sound less buzzword-y.
Say "quick" or "fast" not "instantaneous" to be realistic.

Industry jargon: Use with explanation when necessary.

## 7. Inclusive Language

We always use they/them as default pronouns. We always use person-first language. We always avoid idioms that might not translate globally.

We never use: guys (when referring to mixed groups), crazy or insane (as descriptors), master/slave terminology (use primary/secondary), or grandfathered (use legacy or existing).

## 8. The Essentials

If you remember nothing else:

Always sound like a helpful colleague. Always include specific examples. Always lead with the benefit to the reader.

Never sound like a robot or salesperson. Never use buzzwords without substance. Never make promises we can't keep.

When unsure, check if it helps our reader. Ask yourself if you would say this to a friend. Default to simpler and clearer.

## Pre-publish Checklist

Before publishing, verify the content matches our voice (not too formal or too casual). Ensure it uses approved terms and follows grammar rules. Include required elements like clear calls to action and contact info if needed. Remove any unexplained jargon, typos, or passive voice.
